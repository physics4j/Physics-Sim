# Physics Simulation
![Alt text](http://i.imgur.com/pBbNbjr.png)


A simple(and sloppy) physics simulation.  It simulates a cannon firing a cannonball from the bottom left corner.  Kinematic equations are used to update the ball's velocities.  You can customize the environment that you fire the ball in.

I want to expand this program to include collisions and simple explosions.  I may just end up rewriting it with the library I am developing.

I got too excited about this program so I didn't take time to design it well.  However, I believe it was still successful and set me in the right direction to start developing Jsci, a library that includes classical mechanics.
